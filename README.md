Instructions on How to play the game:

Press enter to start the game.
Use the arrow keys to move.
The main moto  is to reach the top of the water and collect gems to get extra score and collect hearts on the way to gain extra lives.
You have to avoid the bugs(your enemies) as they would kill you(decrease your life)
Each time you reach the top of the water, difficulty level increases.
